Rancid milk is what I consider my first successful trick. Before this trick, I was mostly working on wildly technical tricks without much consideration for movement or flow.

The grateful dead spindox video absolutely blew my mind, and I had to learn kamikaze. Lucky for me, I had supportive parents and my mother drove me to the April 2000 spindox meet (where house of pain was recorded!). All of the spindox were incredibly kind and took me in.

I remember getting some feedback on ragnarok and raging demon, two of my never-ending-tech-tricks, that they were complicated but didn't look good. Which really got my wheels turning, it was great feedback.

So I decided to deconstruct kamikaze and add some around the arm stuff, inspired by diabolo.

Rancid Milk was born.

The ending was hard to teach. I had sort of practiced the movements over and over until I always got the same result, but I didn't really understand the string order/drops until I was asked to teach it, and had to relearn it myself.
